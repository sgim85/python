The Azure AI Custom Vision service enables you to create computer vision models that are trained on your own images. You can use it to train image classification and object detection models; which you can then publish and consume from applications.

In this exercise, you will use the Custom Vision service to train an image classification model that can identify three classes of fruit (apple, banana, and orange).
